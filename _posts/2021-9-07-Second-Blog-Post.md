## Response

I think R is a pretty handy and powerful programming language. It could
manipulate data set using simple functions and those functions are
pretty easy to understand and to be remembered. I have used SAS Python
and SQL, putting SQL away, I think SAS have a more sophisticated
procedure to read data and do the data cleaning method, especially for
the unstructured data set. But SAS is more powerful for doing
statistical analysis, the outputs produced by SAS have more
interpretability. Python, a more object oriented language, also have
lots of advantage, more easier to access API etc. I think R is not a
difficult language to learn as long as you have some programming
background before. I learned R prior to this course and I think there
are lots of functions in R really powerful and convenient for us to use.
Such as some machine learning techniques and statistical modeling. But
sometimes R is pretty slow comparing to Python.
